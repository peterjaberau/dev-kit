// Built-in default window layouts. The repo layout is the DESIGNED first-run
// arrangement (2026-08-21, release-blocker "first-run experience" - it
// replaced a verbatim dev-setup capture from 2026-07-30): the panels a new
// user's first clicks land in, and nothing else.
//
//   Refs | Commits | Commit Details over Working Changes | Diff
//
// Clicking a commit fills Commit Details and swaps Changed Files into the
// Working Changes slot; clicking a file fills the Diff panel - every default
// interaction lands in an already-open group, never splitting the layout.
// Tooling panels (Git Console, Git Command Log, Repo Settings) start closed;
// the placements/fallbacks below pre-seed where panels land when first
// summoned or opened via the View menu. Used whenever the user has not saved
// their own default: first launch and "Reset to default layout" without a
// snapshot. The programmatic builders in RepoDock/GlobalDock stay as the
// last-resort fallback if these fail to apply (e.g. a panel id disappears
// from the registry) - `defaultLayouts.test.ts` guards that drift.
//
// Sizes are design-time pixels for a 1600x900 window; dockview re-scales the
// grid proportionally to the actual window on fromJSON.
//
// Panel entries deliberately carry NO `title`: tab titles live only in the
// panel registry, and the apply path (sanitizeRepoviewLayout) injects them
// from there. When re-capturing these layouts from a live dockview, strip
// the `title` fields again - defaultLayouts.test.ts enforces this.
